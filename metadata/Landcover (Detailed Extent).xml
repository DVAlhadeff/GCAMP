            <edomvd>This ecological system occupies large, seasonally inundated basins with peaty substrates. These basins are nonriverine and do not receive overbank flooding. Examples are generally forested; the vegetation is characterized by Taxodium distichum, Nyssa biflora, evergreen "bay" shrubs, and/or mixed hardwoods. Emergent Pinus elliottii may also be present. Some characteristic shrubs include Cliftonia monophylla, Cyrilla racemiflora, Lyonia lucida, and Smilax laurifolia.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>This ecological system encompasses seepage-fed wetlands in dissected landscapes. Examples are usually associated with ravines or along headwater streams. Vegetation consists of open to closed forests of acid-tolerant wetland hardwoods or pine. Generally there is a dense shrub layer.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Occurs in floodplains of small streams that carry little mineral sediment. A variety of tree species may be present; wetter examples are often strongly dominated by Taxodium distichum and Nyssa biflora. Other examples have mixtures of these species with Quercus spp. and other bottomland hardwoods tolerant of blackwater conditions. Species richness ranges from low to moderate, but is lower than in comparable brownwater systems. Flooding is an important ecological factor in this system and may be the most important factor separating it from adjacent systems.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Examples of this system and component community associations share the common features of wet, seasonally saturated, mineral soils and historic exposure to frequent low-intensity fire. The vegetation is naturally dominated by Pinus palustris or, on wetter sites, Pinus elliottii or less commonly Pinus serotina. In natural condition (frequent fires, including a growing-season component) there tends to be a dense ground cover of herbs and low shrubs; grasses can dominate, but there is often a large diversity of other herbs and shrubs.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>This system of upland Pinus palustris-dominated vegetation was once perhaps the most extensive system in the Outer Coastal Plain within its range. Examples and associations share the common feature of upland (non-wetland) moisture regimes and natural exposure to frequent fire. They occur on a variety of well- to excessively drained soils, and on the higher parts of upland-wetland mosaics. Most associations have an understory of scrub oaks. The herb layer is generally well-developed and dominated by grasses.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Thick stands of Quercus virginiana and/or Quercus geminata are diagnostic of this system. Examples often occupy locally distinct microhabitats that differ from the surrounding landscape, such as shallow depressions or slight topographic highs in a predominantly longleaf pine-dominated landscape. Under more frequent fire regimes, these sites would likely be occupied by longleaf pine.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>This ecological system consists of wetlands in small basins formed in unconsolidated sediments. Vegetation usually ranges from open water or floating-leaved aquatics in the center of the deepest basins, to emergent marsh zones in semipermanent water, to drawdown zones with diverse small graminoid and forb vegetation, to dense shrub or woodland edges. A smaller number of basins may have emergent trees throughout their extent.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>The vegetation consists of an assemblage of xeric communities that also occur in other xeric habitats in the Coastal Plain. These include Pinus palustris - Quercus laevis communities and a scrub community akin to Inland Florida Scrub.This system is distinguished from more typical xeric sandhills of the Coastal Plain by its occurrence on the deep sands of river dunes. In addition this environment is naturally topographically isolated and consequently has a lower fire-return interval than other upland systems of which Pinus palustris is a component.</edomvd>
